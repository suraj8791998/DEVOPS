    git branch <branch_name>   # Create a new branch
    git checkout <branch_name>   # Switch to a different branch

# Merging:

    Understand how to merge changes from one branch into another.
    git merge <branch_name>   # Merge changes from another branch into the current branch

# Resolve Conflicts:

    Learn how to handle conflicts that may arise during merges.
        Manually resolve conflicts in the affected files.
        Use git add to stage the resolved files.
        Commit the changes.

# Remotes:

    Connect your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    Push your code to the remote repository.
      git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
        git push -u origin master

#    Collaboration:
        Learn to collaborate with others using Git. Understand concepts like forking, pull requests, and code 
         reviews on platforms like GitHub.
        Contribute to open source projects to gain practical experience.

 #   Advanced Git Topics:
        Dive into advanced topics like rebasing, tagging, and hooks.
