# Stage 1: Source Control Management (SCM) Integration
This stage connects your CI/CD pipeline to your version control system to track code changes and trigger pipeline execution.
In this example, the pipeline is triggered by code changes using the checkout scm step.

# Stage 2: Code Build
Compile and package your application code. 
This stage uses Maven to build a Java application. Replace the sh command with the appropriate build command for your project.

# Stage 3: Code Quality and Static Analysis
This stage analyzes the code for code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards.
In this example, the SonarQube Scanner is used to perform static code analysis. Ensure you have SonarQube set up and configured for your project.

# Stage 4: Unit Testing
Execute unit tests to verify the correctness of individual code components.
In this example, Maven is used to run unit tests for a Java application. The sh command is used to execute the Maven test command.

# Stage 5: Integration Testing
Test how different parts of the application work together.
In this example, Maven is used to run integration tests for a Java application. The sh command is used to execute the Maven integration-test comman

# Stage 6: Artifact Packaging
Create deployable Docker images with your application code and its dependencies.
In this example, a Docker image is built with a dynamically generated name that includes the build number. The docker build command creates the Docker image using the application code and its dependencies. 
In this stage we need a dockerfile.
Because as we building the image, there are certain rules that how the image has to be build

# Stage 7: Deployment to Staging Environment
Use Ansible to automate the deployment of your Dockerized application to a staging environment
In this example, we assume you have an Ansible playbook named deploy-staging.yml that defines the deployment process to the staging environment. 
The playbook should handle tasks like pulling the Docker image, configuring environment variables, and running containers.

# Stage 8: Notification and Reporting
Notify team members and stakeholders of the pipeline's status and provide detailed reports.
In this stage, you would typically have scripts or steps to send notifications to relevant team members and stakeholders to inform them of the pipeline's status. You might use email, instant messaging, or other communication tools to provide updates.
Additionally, you can generate reports summarizing the pipeline's performance and results for post-execution analysis and review.
