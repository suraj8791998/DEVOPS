# SHELL SCRIPTING 

# Shebang:

     Create a new file in your Linux system using the terminal: nano myscript.sh
  
      Add the shebang line: #!/bin/bash as the first line in the script.
    
        Save the file and exit.

# Comments:

    Within myscript.sh, you can add a comment to describe the script's purpose:

    # This script greets the user
echo "Hello, User!"

# Variables:

    You can create and use variables in your script like this:

    # Variable assignment
         my_var="Shell Scripting is fun!"

   ** Printing the variable's value**   echo $my_var
