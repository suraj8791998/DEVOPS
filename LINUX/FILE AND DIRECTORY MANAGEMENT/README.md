**1.Navigation:**

     Use ls to list files in the current directory.
     
     Use cd to change directories. For example, cd Documents to enter the "Documents" directory.
     
**2.Creating Directories:**

     Use mkdir to create a new directory. 
     
         For instance, mkdir NewFolder creates a directory named "NewFolder."
         
**3.Creating Files:**

     Use touch to create an empty file. 
     
         Example: touch NewFile.txt creates a file named "NewFile.txt."
         
**4.Copying and Moving:**

     Use cp to copy files/directories.
     
         Example: cp File.txt /path/to/destination copies "File.txt" to the specified destination.
         
     Use mv to move/rename files/directories. Example: mv File.txt NewLocation/ moves "File.txt" to "NewLocation/".
     
**5.Removing:**
     
     Use rm to delete files. 
        
        Example: rm OldFile.txt removes "OldFile.txt."
        
     Use rmdir to delete empty directories. 
        
        Example: rmdir EmptyDirectory deletes an empty directory.
        
**6.Viewing File Contents:**
     
     Use cat/more to display the entire contents of a file. 
     
        Example: cat TextFile.txt./more TextFile.txt

     Differences between Cat and More :

       > Cat and more commands in linux are both used for viewing file contents, but they have distinct functionalities

       > cat useful for small files and display the entire content of a file at once

       > more useful for large files without overhelming the terminal

     Head :
     
        > Displays the first 10 lines of a file

        > Useful for quickly previewing the beginning of a file

     Tail :

        > Display the last 10 lines of a file

        > Useful for checking the end of log files
